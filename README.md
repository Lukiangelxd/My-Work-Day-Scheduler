:memo: # My-Work-Day-Scheduler :memo:

## Background 
The purpose of this project is to reflect skills that I have learned through knowledge of jQuery and Day.js library for my time at UCONN Bootcaamp coding class. Using HTML, CSS and Javascript I will be able to show this through my code below.
## Description
I have developed a daily scheduling tool for tracking events within a typical 9-5 workday. The current date and day are prominently showcased at the page's header. Time segments are differentiated by color, representing past, present, and future periodsâ€”past indicated by grey, present by red, and future by green. Upon inputting and saving events, the content is stored in local storage, ensuring its persistence even after a page refresh. Additionally, integrated a functionality that disables the save button when no text input is detected. Constructed using VsCode, alongside Jquery, bootstrap, and Day.js libraries.
