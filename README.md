## Background 
I designed and developed a user-friendly daily planner with the intention of facilitating event scheduling within the framework of a typical 9-to-5 standard business day. At the uppermost section of the page, I ensured that the current date and day of the week are prominently displayed for the user's convenience.

To enhance usability, I incorporated a clever color-coding system for the time blocks. This feature assists users in distinguishing between past, present, and future times. Specifically, I employed the color grey to signify events in the past, red to denote the present moment, and green to represent future time slots.

Furthermore, to ensure that users can rely on the longevity of their entered event details, I implemented a local storage function. This means that the text they input is automatically saved and preserved, even if the page is refreshed or reopened.

Taking user experience into account, I introduced a handy feature that disables the save button when no text is input, thereby preventing unnecessary actions and ensuring data integrity.

For the technical aspects of this project, I harnessed the power of various tools and technologies. Specifically, I used VsCode as my integrated development environment (IDE), and I leveraged the capabilities of jQuery for efficient DOM manipulation. To enhance the visual appeal and responsiveness of the planner, I incorporated Bootstrap. Additionally, Day.js was employed to facilitate date and time-related operations, contributing to the overall functionality of this well-rounded daily planner.
